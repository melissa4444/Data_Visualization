## Health Care Data Design Project

### Dataset - U.S population current or have been on Adderall for ADHD 
Choose 20-30 year olds who have ADHD and are currently taking the medication for the past two years.

### Hypothese: 

It's a frequent misconception that if a patient has a medical issue, they may take a prescription and the disorder can improve or subside. That is, improvement is proportional to the medication. However, it turns out that there's a significant possibility the patient might have improved even if the treatment hadn't already been given. There's also the possibility that a treatment will have no effect.

### Visualization Goal:
#### 1. Data about side effects risk
#### 2. Showing how side effects change over time
#### 3. Likelihood of side effects
#### 4. Positive behavior change
#### 5. Benefits of risk reduction
#### 6. Racial disparities in rated of disorder


### Questions:  

Compare Male vs. Female data to demonstrate

What are the chances that the drug treatment helps?

How much time did it take for patients to notice changes?
 
How many patients experienced side effects?

Was there an overall improvement in attention span?
