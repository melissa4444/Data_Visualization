## Health Care Data Design Project - Disability and Health Data System (DHDS)

### Dataset - Dataset - U.S population - CDC 2021 U.S

#### Categories: Male, Non Medicated Male, Female, Non Medicated Female

### Overview:

    The disabled population has been underrepresented for many years in the United States. There are many types of disabilities that are either visible or invisible, this causes for an inadequate visualization of the disabled population. By creating better and simple visuals regarding disablities will allow society to better understand the statistics regarding disabilities. 
    
    Creating visualization that are both readable and clear is important because it gives the population transparency without the invasion of privacy. This allows individual from all walks of life to better comprehend the actual data, giving them answers to questions they have. 
    
    Research has found that 65% of the general population are visible learners, meaning that they need to see the information in order to retain it. I will be exploring the CDC Disability and Health Data Systems DHDS to create visualizations regarding mental, physical, social economical, and racial demographics within the nation. I also will analyze the trends and patterns of each year. I did have to change some  questions from the proposal after inspecting the data.
  
    Research in data management, machine learning and security have come to the conclusion that the notion of data cleaning in modern machine learning is critical. Machine learning has become widely used in sensitive applications, causing the need for model accuracy within the learning model. In addition to its accuracy the machine must not discriminate certain demographics of people or be sensitive to adversarial data. After all, machine learning is only as good as its data, and no matter how good the training algorithm, the ultimate problem lies in data itself.

### Visualization Goal:
#### 1. Disablity data
#### 2. Data regarding age
#### 3. Data regarding gender
#### 4. Racial disparities


# Hypothesized Questions:

   **Q1 What percentage of peoples over the age of 18 have a disability?**

   **Q2 What kind of disabilities were being reported?**

   **Q3 Which year had the most disabilities?**

   **Q4 What percentage of adults have cognitive disability?**

   **Q5 How does the data vary based on location?**

   **Q6 How does race correlate with individuals a disability?**

   **Q7 How many Working professionals have Disabilities**

# Visualization Goal:

1. Types of Disabilities
2. Disability data within States
3. Racial disparities

4. Data regarding age  
5. Data regarding gender
6. Insured Vs. Non-Insured 


### DATA

    "Disability and Health Data System (DHDS) is an online source of state-level data on adults with disabilities. Users can access information on six functional disability types: cognitive (serious difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions), hearing (serious difficulty hearing or deaf), mobility (serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs), vision (serious difficulty seeing), self-care (difficulty dressing or bathing) and independent living (difficulty doing errands alone)."

## How to Run: 
 To associate data file with Git LFS to add git lfs track. This command amends your repository's .gitattributes file and associates large files with Git LFS.
