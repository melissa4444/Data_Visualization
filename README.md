## Health Care Data Design Project - Disability and Health Data System (DHDS)

### Dataset - Dataset - U.S population - CDC 2021 U.S 

### Hypothese: 

The year 2020 highlighted many issues in our nation, the biggest red flag during the time was the decline in mental and physical health. I would like to explore the data and create visualizations regarding the mental, physical, social economical, and racial components within the past year.   

"Disability and Health Data System (DHDS) is an online source of state-level data on adults with disabilities. Users can access information on six functional disability types: cognitive (serious difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions), hearing (serious difficulty hearing or deaf), mobility (serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs), vision (serious difficulty seeing), self-care (difficulty dressing or bathing) and independent living (difficulty doing errands alone)."

### Visualization Goal:
#### 1. Gender Data
#### 2. Health issues categorized
#### 3. Age Data
#### 4. Health Care data
#### 5. Insured Vs. Non-Insured
#### 6. Racial disparities in health issues 


### Questions:  
#### Categorized as gender, race, and insured/not insured.
#### What percentage of peoples over the age of 18 experienced mild, moderate, or severe symptoms of depression and anxiety?
#### What percentage of adults have chronic illness compared to insured adults 
#### Are Children ages 12â€“17 years old more likely to have taken prescription medication, and received counseling or therapy from a mental health professional.
#### How does race correlate with individuals being insured or not?
