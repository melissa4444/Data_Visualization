Hypothese: 

It's a frequent misconception that if a patient has a medical issue, they may take a prescription and the disorder can improve or subside. That is, improvement is proportional to the medication. However, it turns out that there's a significant possibility the patient might have improved even if the treatment hadn't already been given. There's also the possibility that a treatment will have no effect.
