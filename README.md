## Health Care Data Design Project - Disability and Health Data System (DHDS)

### Dataset - Dataset - U.S population - CDC 2021 U.S

#### Categories: Male, Non Medicated Male, Female, Non Medicated Female

### Overview:

The year 2020 was a difficult year I want to analyze the CDC data to further understand how many people in our nation have disablities and what kind. 

I would like to explore the CDC Disability and Health Data Systems DHDS and create visualizations regading mental, physical, social econmical, racial demograpfic within that year. 

I had to change my questions from my proposal after going through the data to correlate it.


### Visualization Goal:
#### 1. Disablity data
#### 2. Data regarding age
#### 3. Data regarding gender
#### 4. Racial disparities


### Questions I wish to address:  
- What percentage of peoples over the age of 18 have a disablity?

- What percentage of adults have cognative disablity compared to visable?

- How does the data vary based on location?

- How does race correlate with individuals a disablity?

"Disability and Health Data System (DHDS) is an online source of state-level data on adults with disabilities. Users can access information on six functional disability types: cognitive (serious difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions), hearing (serious difficulty hearing or deaf), mobility (serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs), vision (serious difficulty seeing), self-care (difficulty dressing or bathing) and independent living (difficulty doing errands alone)."

## How to Run: 
 To associate data file with Git LFS to add git lfs track. This command amends your repository's .gitattributes file and associates large files with Git LFS.
